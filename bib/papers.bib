  author =       "Jarek Rossignac",
  abstract =     "Edgebreaker is a simple scheme for compressing the
                 triangle/vertex incidence graphs (sometimes called
                 connectivity or topology) of three-dimensional triangle
                 meshes. Edgebreaker improves upon the storage required
                 by previously reported schemes, most of which can
                 guarantee only an O(t log(t)) storage cost for the
                 incidence graph of a mesh of t triangles. Edgebreaker
                 requires at most 2t bits for any mesh homeomorphic to a
                 sphere and supports fully general meshes by using
                 additional storage per handle and hole. For large
                 meshes, entropy coding yields less than 1.5 bits per
                 triangle. Edgebreaker's compression and decompression
                 processes perform identical traversals of the mesh from
                 one triangle to an adjacent one. At each stage,
                 compression produces an op-code describing the
                 topological relation between the current triangle and
                 the boundary of the remaining part of the mesh.
                 Decompression uses these op-codes to reconstruct the
                 entire incidence graph. Because Edgebreaker's
                 compression and decompression are independent of the
                 vertex locations, they may be combined with a variety
                 of vertex-compressing techniques that exploit
                 topological information about the mesh to better
                 estimate vertex locations. Edgebreaker may be used to
                 compress the connectivity of an entire mesh bounding a
                 3D polyhedron or the connectivity of a triangulated
                 surface patch whose boundary need not be encoded. The
                 paper also offers a comparative survey of the rapidly
                 growing field of geometric compression.",

                 in major industry segments, the affordability of
                 interactive 3-D rendering for office and consumer use,
                 and the exploitation of the Internet to distribute and
                 share 3-D data have intensified the need for an
                 effective 3-D geometric compression technique that
                 would significantly reduce the time required to
                 transmit 3-D models over digital communication
                 channels, and the amount of memory or disk space
                 required to store the models. Because the prevalent
                 representation of 3-D models for graphics purposes is
                 polyhedral and because polyhedral models are in general
                 triangulated for rendering, this article introduces a
                 new compressed representation for complex triangulated
                 models and simple, yet efficient, compression and
                 decompression algorithms. In this scheme, vertex
                 positions are quantized within the desired accuracy, a
                 vertex spanning tree is used to predict the position of
                 each vertex from 2,3, or 4 of its ancestors in the
                 tree, and the correction vectors are entropy encoded.
                 Properties, such as normals, colors, and texture
                 coordinates, are compressed in a similar manner. The
                 connectivity is encoded with no loss of information to
                 an average of less than two bits per triangle. The
                 vertex spanning tree and a small set of jump edges are
                 used to split the model into a simple polygon. A
                 triangle spanning tree and a sequence of marching bits
                 are used to encode the triangulation of the polygon.
                 Our approach improves on Michael Deering's pioneering
                 results by exploiting the geometric coherence of
                 several ancestors in the vertex spanning tree,
                 preserving the connectivity with no loss of
                 information, avoiding vertex repetitions, and using
                 about three fewer bits for the connectivity. However,
                 since decompression requires random access to all
                 vertices, this method must be modified for hardware
                 rendering with limited onboard memory. Finally, we
                 demonstrate implementation results for a variety of
                 {VRML} models with up to two orders of magnitude
                 compression.",
